    interfaceResidues -- finds 'interface' residues between two chains in a complex.
    
    PARAMS
        cmpx
            The complex containing cA and cB
        
        cA
            The first chain in which we search for residues at an interface
            with cB
        
        cB
            The second chain in which we search for residues at an interface
            with cA
        
        cutoff
            The difference in area OVER which residues are considered
            interface residues.  Residues whose dASA from the complex to
            a single chain is greater than this cutoff are kept.  Zero
            keeps all residues.
            
        selName
            The name of the selection to return.
            
    RETURNS
        * A selection of interface residues is created and named
            depending on what you passed into selName
        * An array of values is returned where each value is:
            ( modelName, residueNumber, dASA )
            
    NOTES
        If you have two chains that are not from the same PDB that you want
        to complex together, use the create command like:
            create myComplex, pdb1WithChainA or pdb2withChainX
        then pass myComplex to this script like:
            interfaceResidues myComplex, c. A, c. X
            
    This script calculates the area of the complex as a whole.  Then,
    it separates the two chains that you pass in through the arguments
    cA and cB, alone.  Once it has this, it calculates the difference
    and any residues ABOVE the cutoff are called interface residues.
