MSc thesis - key codes and output files used to analyse pairwise transcription factor interactions during the first 12 hours of neural induction

The following scripts within this repository will enable readers to understand how relevant
transcription factors to the chicken Galgal5 genome were extracted and how the
pairwise correlation matrix was constructed. 

All file names reflect the nature of the code used for this MSc research project.
Output files of our code have also been included in this repository for the reader's reference.
